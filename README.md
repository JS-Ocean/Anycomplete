### Installation.

Once Hammerspoon is installed, copy `urlencode.lua` to ~/.hammerspoon/urlencode.lua and the content of `google-autocomplete.lua` to ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua. Reload the Hammerspoon config. Once installed, the action is bound to CTRL+ALT+CMD+G. That can be changed by editing [hs.hotkey.bind](https://github.com/nathancahill/hammerspoon-config/blob/master/google-autocomplete.lua#L5).
